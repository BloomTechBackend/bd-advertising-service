## Project Preparedness Task 2: Hello Project Buddy

**Reviewer: Project Buddy**

Don't worry, you're not alone in this project! Not only do you have your instructors and TAs in office hours to rely on, 
but you have your own project buddy! You will receive an e-mail from ATA with the name and alias of your unit five 
project buddy. Send them an email introducing yourself with the following information:

* Your background at Amazon
* A hobby or fun fact
* Any lessons learned from working with your project buddies in previous units. Were there things that your previous 
project buddies did that you found particularly useful? Are there any specific things you would like your buddy to help 
you work on?
* Your preference for working through design reviews and ask for their preference (chime meeting, e-mail, in-person, 
etc.)

If you happen to be working with your project buddy from the previous unit, we would still like you to send an email. 
You should include anything you would like to work on specifically with the help of your project buddy, and confirm your 
design review communications. If something didn't work especially well last unit, please try to change it up!
Once you and your project buddy have decided how you will communicate about design reviews, document this decision in a 
file called `preparedness-task2.txt` in the `src/resources` directory. Once you can run the `preparedness-task2` 
workflow and it passes, put your changes out in a CR to your project buddy.
The title of your commit and CR must begin with `[PPT02]`. Once they have approved the CR, push this code to your 
pipeline.

**Exit Checklist:**

* You've contacted your project buddy and agreed on a communication method
* You've documented it in a file called `preparedness-task2.txt`
* `rde wflow run preparedness-task2` passes
* Your CR with the communication file has been approved by your project buddy and pushed
* Project Preparedness Task 2 TCTs are passing in your pipeline.
